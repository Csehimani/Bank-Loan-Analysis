# Bank-Loan-Analysis
Bank loan analysis using SQL Server Database and MS Power Bi.
The Power BI report analyzes bank loan data, providing key insights into loan applications, funded amounts, interest rates, and customer demographics. It is structured into three main sections: Summary, Overview, and Details, each offering a different level of granularity.

Conclusion:
Top Performing Segments: Debt consolidation loans and loans with a 36-month term contribute significantly to total funded amounts.
Good Loans Dominance: Most loans fall under "good loans," showcasing strong repayment trends and lower risk profiles.
Regional Trends: The report highlights states with higher funding and repayment rates.
Optimization Areas: Focus on reducing DTI ratios for better risk management and identifying regions with higher default risks for targeted interventions.
This report effectively analyses the bank's loan data, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions.
